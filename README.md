This project was completed as part of the IBM “Analyzing Data with Excel” course on edX.
It involved analyzing a real-world sales dataset provided by the course using Microsoft Excel.

I performed data cleaning and preparation by correcting formats, removing duplicates, and organizing the dataset for analysis.
Using PivotTables and charts, I explored:

Total sales by product line

Yearly and country-wise performance

Top customers contributing to sales


Finally, I summarized key insights and business conclusions based on patterns in sales performance.

This project demonstrates my ability to use Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization — essential skills in data analytics.
Successfully completed and certified by IBM through edX.
