# ibm-excel-data-analysis-project-
This project was created as part of the final assessment for the IBM “Analyzing Data with Excel” course on edX.
It focuses on applying Excel for real-world business data analysis. Using a sales dataset, I performed data cleaning, created PivotTables, and built charts to explore sales performance.

The analysis covered total sales by product line, yearly and regional trends, and top customers contributing to revenue.
Through this project, I practiced key data analytics skills such as data preparation, summarization, and visualization using Excel tools.

Successfully completed the course and earned the IBM certificate on edX.

Key Insights
Classic Cars and Vintage Cars were the most profitable product lines.
Sales remained consistent across years, showing stable business performance.
A few key customers and countries contributed a large portion of total revenue.
Focusing on top-performing products and regions could improve future growth.
